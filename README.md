## Artificial Intelligence projects

Development of two AI-driven projects for the IART Curricular Unit:

1. [**Chesskoban**](proj1): a puzzle game that merges Chess mechanics with the Sokoban format. AI is used to generate the most efficient solutions and provide hints to the player, enhancing the gameplay experience for both chess enthusiasts and beginners.

2. [**Spruce Tree Type Detection**](proj2): this project employs supervised learning techniques to classify spruce tree types. Algorithms such as Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Nearest Neighbor are used to analyze and categorize tree types based on specific features.
