# Spruce tree type detection

## Project description
This project focuses on applying supervised learning techniques to classify examples in terms of spruce tree type detection.
#### Grade: 18/20

## Supervised algorithms
The algorithms chosen for this project were:
- Decision Tree
- SVC
- Nearest Neighbor
- Random Forest
- Logistic Regression
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Multi-layer Perceptron
- XGBoost
- LightGBM
- CatBoost
- GradientBoosting

## Developed models
The project addresses class imbalance by oversampling minority classes. This function duplicates instances of the minority class to ensure that the model has enough examples from all classes during training.
#### Metrics used:
- Accuracy
- AUC
- Recall
- F1 score
- Cohen's kappa
- Correlation coefficient
- Precision
- Training time

## Instalation and execution
In order to run the project, it is required to have python3 installed.
